                The Clone Wars is a very popular Star Wars series created by George Lucas and Dave Filoni. It had 133 episodes in 7 seasons and was aired for 12 years.Its great success was due to its unique take on the Star Wars franchise. The series takes place between "Attack of the Clones" and "Revenge of the Sith". When these movies came out, there was a large chunk of the timeline that was empty. The Clone Wars took advantage of this and filled the gap. The show introduced dozens of new characters and made the fictious galaxy more alive. It was incredebly violent for a kids show and gave fan favorites more screen time before they died in the prequel movies. It made clones relatable and made Order 66 a much more impactful moment. This sereis also gave rise to many others that wouldn't make sense without this show as context.

                    <h3 style="color: white;">My Personal Thoughts</h3>
                    <p style="color: white;">
                    I have watched this show for many years and will probably rewatch it again in the future. It introduced some of my favorite characters in all of Star Wars. It also had some of the best action scenes I have ever seen in a Star Wars series. I loved the story telling style, as well as the sheer variety in storylines. It filled the hole between the second and third movies that would have hurt the franchise if it was left unfilled. Some episodes were on military campaigns and others on politics, preventing it from being stale. I love this show and will rewatch it for years to come.
